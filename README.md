### Business Problem 

Foodhub, a food aggregator company, offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app. The company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get an understanding of the demand of different restaurants in order to enhance their customer experience. 


### Task

Perform an exploratory data analysis to find answers to the questions below that will help the company to improve business.


### Questions to answer

What restaurants are people ordering from?

What cuisine is most popular?

When are people placing orders?

How much are they paying?

How long does it take to receive their order?

How are customers rating their order?


### Insights

Of the 1898 orders recorded, 71.18% were placed on the weekend, Saturday or Sunday. This analysis will focus on orders placed on the weekends in order to highlight areas of opportunity when a vast majority of customers are utilizing the app.

Most of the order are either American (30.72%), Japanese (24.80%), Italian (15.32%), or Chinese cuisine (12.07%). These cuisines have the four most number of restaurants currently available on the app: 41 American, 29 Japanese, 31 Italian, and 16 Chinese.

Focusing on the top four cuisines, there is a similar pattern regarding distribution of orders between restaurants in each cuisine. Typically the most popular 3-4 restaurants will make up over 60% of the business for that cuisine. American cuisine differs from the rest because the majority of business is concentrated on the top 2 restaurants, Shake Shack and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken, with an emphasis on the first.

A pattern among the top performing restaurants on the app is that they are either a part of a chain (Shake Shack, TAO) or the restaurant has several locations across the city (Sushi of Gari Tribeca, Sushi of Gari 46). 

The average total time from placing the order to receiving the order was 49.91 minutes on the weekend. American, Japanese, and Italian cuisine restaurants averaged a slightly higher total time - 50.00, 50.12, and 50.22 respectively. Focusing on American cuisine, the top 2 performing restaurants, Shake Shack and Blue Ribbon Fried Chicken averaged total delivery times of 50.55 and 50.18 respectively which is slightly above the average for that cuisine.  

About 43.30% of orders on the weekend were given a rating with the average being 4.36/5. As expected, American, Japanese, Italian, and Chinese cuisines were more likely to be given rating compared to the others. The top ten restaurants by rating count are of the four cuisines previously mentioned but only 3 of the restaurants were above the average rating 4.3.
